# Login & Registration
This sub-project involves basic GET, POST CRUD operations such as adding a new user to database while registering. And after successfull registration, user can login to the home page displayed. It was accomplished using AXIOS library written in ReactJS code (frontend services) for calling the RESTful services created using NodeJS + expressJS (backend services). Data gets saved to the MongoDB database while registering and called upon when user tries to log in.
